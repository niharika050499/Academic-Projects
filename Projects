5. Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn Prediction in E-commerce

Objective:
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in an e-commerce business, enabling the company to proactively retain customers by implementing targeted marketing strategies.

Project Overview:

Data Collection: Gathered customer data from a real-world e-commerce dataset, which included information on user behavior, transaction history, and engagement patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and conducting feature engineering to extract valuable insights such as average purchase frequency and customer lifetime value.
Model Development:
Used Python libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow to build various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluated the performance of models using metrics such as ROC-AUC, precision, and recall to select the best-performing model.
Deployed the final model using Flask and Gradio to create an easy-to-use interface for business analysts.
Outcome: The predictive model achieved an accuracy of 87% in predicting customer churn, and insights derived from feature importance led to actionable recommendations that could help the business reduce churn by 15%.
Tools & Technologies:

Python (scikit-learn, pandas, TensorFlow)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Cloud Deployment: AWS EC2
Version Control: GitHub
Interface: Flask, Gradio
